            RECs, or Renewable Energy Credits, are a convenient and effective way of supporting clean energy usage. Basically, 
            for a certain extra fee, your provider will add renewable energy onto the grid. This can either be done in blocks or
            based on your usage. If you buy a block of renewable energy, you essentially pay a fixed price for a fixed amount of 
            kW*hrs of renewable energy added to the provider's grid.

            Block 1: 
            Block 2:
            Block 3:

            Alternatively, you can choose to switch your entire usage to the REC system. This will mean that for each kW*hr of 
            energy you use per month (avg: xxx kW*hr), you pay an additional fee of $xxx on top of the general pricing.
