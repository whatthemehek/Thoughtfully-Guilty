                <h3>Renewable Energy Credits</h3>
                <h4>Program Name: My Clean Energy</h4>
        <       <h4>Sourcing: Mix of Wind, Solar, and other Renewables </h4>
                <p>
                    RECs, or Renewable Energy Credits, are a convenient and effective way of supporting clean energy usage. Basically, 
                    for a certain extra fee, your provider will add renewable energy onto the grid. With Avista, you essentially pay a 
                    fixed price for a fixed amount of kWh of renewable energy added to the provider's grid: $1 for offsetting 100 kWh.
                    Since the average Avista customer uses about 900 kWh per month, ofsetting 100% of your usage would add an average 
                    of $9 per month to your energy bill.

                <h3>Community Solar/Shared Solar</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the SEIA, "Community solar refers to local solar facilities shared by multiple community subscribers
                    who receive credit on their electricity bills for their share of the power produced." Programs such as these bring 
                    the benefits of rooftop solar, such as offsetting the costs of energy bills and a greener source of energy, to people 
                    who may not have the capability to build a rooftop solar grid. 
                    With community solar, depending on the share of the community grid that you purchase, you will receive a credit on your
                    each month equivalent to your share's percent of the total energy generated by the grid that month. To buy a share,
                    Avista's community solar program is currently sold out, and its shared solar program is waitlist only. Until Avista opens
                    more community solar options, it's probably not a feasible green option.

                <h3>Rebates</h3>
                <p>
                    Rebates are a great way to reduce your energy usage and save money while doing it. Basically,
                    Provider xxx has incentives for buying specific energy-efficient appliances, lighting, heating, 
                    etc. By providing a receipt of the energy efficient product, your energy provider will give you
                    a certain amount of money back on your purchase.
